"""Notebook 42: durable agent threads on Oracle Database 26ai.

In-memory and on-disk checkpointers are fine for local development —
when the process restarts, the conversation is gone. This notebook
wires Locus's ``oracle_checkpointer`` into an ``Agent`` so the agent
loop itself writes ``AgentState`` (messages, metrics, all of it) to
Oracle 26ai after every iteration. A second ``Agent`` instance — built
fresh, simulating a different process — loads the same ``thread_id``
and the conversation continues uninterrupted.

The point: it isn't a state-blob primitive demo. The *Locus agent
runtime* is the protagonist; Oracle 26ai is the durable substrate it
checkpoints into. The user never calls ``cp.save`` — the agent does
that for them.

Key concepts:

- ``oracle_checkpointer(...)`` returns a ``StorageBackendAdapter``
  wrapped around ``OracleBackend``. Pass it to ``Agent(checkpointer=...)``
  and the agent loop persists state on every iteration.
- ``agent.run_sync(prompt, thread_id="...")`` loads state for that
  thread before the first model call and saves after each iteration.
- ``checkpoint_every_n_iterations=1`` saves after every iteration
  (already the default for this adapter on a thread), so a process
  killed mid-turn loses at most the iteration in flight.
- ``cp.list_threads()`` on the agent's own checkpointer — the
  enumeration an admin dashboard would use (see the note in
  ``first_session``).

The demo simulates two sessions. Session 1 starts a conversation and
the agent persists the state to Oracle automatically. Session 2 spins
up a brand-new ``Agent`` instance — different Python object, same
``thread_id``, same Oracle pool — and the agent recalls turn 1 without
being told what was said.

Run it:
    export ORACLE_DSN=mydb_low                   # tnsnames alias
    export ORACLE_USER=locus_app                 # least-privileged app schema
    export ORACLE_PASSWORD='<app-password>'
    export ORACLE_WALLET=~/.oci/wallets/mydb
    export ORACLE_WALLET_PASSWORD='<wallet-pw>'  # if the wallet is encrypted

    python examples/notebook_42_oracle_26ai_checkpointer.py

If any of ``ORACLE_DSN``, ``ORACLE_USER``, ``ORACLE_PASSWORD`` or
``ORACLE_WALLET`` is unset the notebook prints the missing names and
the wiring snippet, then exits cleanly — no traceback, no
half-initialised state.

Difficulty: Intermediate. Self-contained — no prior notebook required.
