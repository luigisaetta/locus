# Customer Support Concession Approval

Support organizations gate costly concessions behind a tier-based
escalation chain: the more a concession costs and the more precedent it
sets, the more approvals it takes.

This example runs four support tickets of rising risk through a
`StateGraph`. A ticket analyst summarizes what the customer is asking
for, an impact analyst weighs the cost of the concession and its
precedent risk against the customer's standing and the downside of a
denial (churn, escalation, public complaint), and a risk-tier router
sends the case to automatic approval or to up to three human gates —
support manager, billing lead, support director — each a separate
`interrupt()`.

The terminal node, the decision recorder (the
`scribe-decision-recorder` agent in the source), emits a typed
`ConcessionDecision` Pydantic model, ready to file into a concessions
ledger without parsing. A large refund or contract make-good commits
real money and sets a precedent other customers will cite, which is why
the impact assessment sits in front of the gates.

What this notebook covers:

- Risk-tier router is a plain conditional edge — no domain-specific
  language (DSL), no policy file.
- Each gate is its own node — easy to add a tier, easy to re-order,
  easy to swap a human gate for an automated rule.
- `output_schema=ConcessionDecision` keeps the terminal artifact typed.

The drawing is the graph the example builds: the risk score arrives with
the ticket, a score under 25 is approved automatically, 25–49 stops at
the support manager, 50–74 adds the billing lead, 75 and above adds the
support director, and a no at any gate goes straight to the decision
recorder with status `denied`:

## Key lines

One factory builds the three human gates. The `interrupt()` payload
carries the tier, the question and the yes/no options — all the run loop
needs to print the gate — and `_record_decision` turns the answer into
state: a yes appends the approver's title to `approvals`, a no sets
`status` to `denied`, which is what the gate functions check before
climbing a tier:

The wiring is ordinary graph edges. `risk_tier_router` is a plain
conditional edge off the impact assessment: a score under 25 goes to
`auto_approve`, every other tier enters at the manager gate, and
`gate_after_manager` and `gate_after_billing` climb to the next tier only
while the score requires it and no gate has said no:

{{ locus_source examples/notebook_78_concession_approval.py::build_review_graph }}

The run loop answers each gate from a scripted list. `execute()` returns
with `result.interrupt` set at every gate and the reviewer's answer goes
back inside `Command(resume=...)`. The graph has no checkpointer, so the
state travels back in the same `Command`: the returned `final_state`
carries a `__resume_node__` marker that `execute()` pops to find the gate
to re-run, and the loop keeps the model object in that state so every
later node can still build its agent:

## Run it

```bash
python examples/notebook_78_concession_approval.py
```

Model choice comes from `examples/config.py`: OCI Generative AI when
`~/.oci/config` has a usable profile, otherwise the bundled mock model, so the
example also runs offline with no credentials. Set `LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER`
(`oci`, `openai`, `anthropic` or `mock`) to force one.

The decision recorder needs a model that can honor the `ConcessionDecision`
JSON schema. The mock model returns plain text, so under it `output_schema`
yields no parsed `ConcessionDecision` and the `record_decision` node raises.
`execute()` records the failed node and returns `success=False` rather than
propagating the error, and `main()` does not check `result.success`, so the
script prints the gates and the reviewer answers, reports the final decision
as `(missing)` and still exits with status 0:

```bash
LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock python examples/notebook_78_concession_approval.py
```

Pin a model that supports structured output; the direct `openai` form needs
`OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment:

```bash
export LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
export LOCUS_MODEL_ID=gpt-4o
python examples/notebook_78_concession_approval.py
```
