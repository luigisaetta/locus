# Basic graph

Build a data subject access request (DSAR) triage workflow as a graph of
nodes that pass state to each other. A `StateGraph` is a directed graph in
which each node is a function — async here — that receives the current
state and returns a dict of updates to merge back. Use it when one `Agent`
is not enough: a multi-step privacy pipeline (parse → enrich → verdict) or
fan-out and fan-in across enrichment lookups. The same primitives carry the
branching logic of [Notebook 13](notebook_13_conditional_routing.md) and
the human approval gates of [Notebook 15](notebook_15_human_in_the_loop.md)
before a DSAR response goes out.

What this notebook covers:

- Nodes and edges; the `START` and `END` sentinel node ids.
- Sequential and parallel flow on the same primitives; conditional routing
  follows in Notebook 13.
- `GraphResult` — final state plus per-node status, timing, and order. The
  final state also keeps each node's raw output under a `_node_<id>` key,
  which the Part 3 `receives` lines show and the final-state printouts
  filter out.
- Streaming node updates and pushing custom progress events from inside a
  node.
- An `Agent` embedded inside a graph node.

The drawing shows the general shape of a `StateGraph`: `START` hands the
input state to a chain of nodes joined by fixed edges, each node merging its
return value into the shared state, and a conditional edge after the last
node either loops back for another pass or reaches `END` with the final
state. The triage pipelines in this notebook are built from the same
`add_node` and `add_edge` calls; the dashed edges, chosen by a router, are
the one primitive they do not use yet:

## Key lines

Three triage nodes, `parse`, `enrich` and `verdict`, are added by name and
joined by fixed edges from `START` to `END`; `graph.execute` runs them in
order, and each node's return value merges into the state the next one
receives:

{{ locus_source examples/notebook_12_basic_graph.py::example_sequence }}

Nodes that become ready in the same step run concurrently by default
(`GraphConfig.parallel` is `True`); the example sets
`graph.config.parallel = True` only to make that explicit. The three
enrichment nodes, each with an edge from `START`, are started together,
their results are merged into the state one after another, and the single
`combine` node they all lead to runs in the next step and reads them from
the merged state:

{{ locus_source examples/notebook_12_basic_graph.py::example_parallel }}

`graph.stream` drives the run on a background task and yields a
`StreamEvent` as each node completes; in `UPDATES` mode the event carries
the dict the node returned. `emit_custom` pushes a `CUSTOM` event onto the
same stream from inside a node while it is still running (its `node_id` is
`None` unless the caller passes one), and is a silent no-op under
`graph.execute`, so the node body works unchanged either way:

## Run it

```bash
python examples/notebook_12_basic_graph.py
```

Model choice comes from `examples/config.py`: OCI Generative AI when
`~/.oci/config` has a usable profile, otherwise the bundled mock model, so the
example also runs offline with no credentials. Set `LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER`
(`oci`, `openai`, `anthropic` or `mock`) to force one.

Parts 1, 2, 4 and 7 call the model once each; Parts 3, 5 and 6 make no
model call. To stay offline regardless of what `~/.oci/config` holds, force
the mock model:

```bash
LOCUS_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock python examples/notebook_12_basic_graph.py
```
