"""ReAct loop primitives. **Deprecated — scheduled for removal in 3.0.0.**

This is a second ReAct implementation, parallel to the one the supported
``Agent`` actually runs. ``Agent`` has never used it: the only reference from
the production runtime was one private helper, and that has moved to
:mod:`locus.tools.executor`.

Two implementations of the same idea is worse than either alone. They drift,
a bug fixed in one stays live in the other, and a reader deciding whether this
project is disciplined greps for exactly this. Nothing here is a capability
:class:`~locus.agent.Agent` lacks.

What to use instead:

===========================  ==================================================
``ReActLoop`` / ``create_react_loop``  :class:`locus.agent.Agent`
``LoopRunner``               ``await agent.arun(prompt)``
``BatchRunner``              :class:`locus.evaluation.EvalRunner`, or
                             ``asyncio.gather`` over ``arun``
``StreamingCollector``       ``async for event in agent.run(prompt)``
``ThinkNode`` / ``ExecuteNode`` / ``ReflectNode``
                             the phases are internal to ``Agent``; hook them
                             with :mod:`locus.hooks`
``ConditionalRouter``        :class:`locus.multiagent.StateGraph` conditional
                             edges, or :mod:`locus.router`
===========================  ==================================================

Importing a name from here still works and will keep working until 3.0.0, per
:doc:`/DEPRECATION`. Each access emits
:class:`~locus.core.warnings.LocusDeprecationWarning`; to find them in your own
code, run with ``-W error::DeprecationWarning``.
