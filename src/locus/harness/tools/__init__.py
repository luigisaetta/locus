"""The harness tool bodies, written once over any workspace backend.

Each ``make_<name>`` builds one :class:`~locus.tools.decorator.Tool` bound
to a :class:`~locus.harness.tools.common.HarnessContext`. No body calls a
gate: governance is applied around the built tool, in one place, by
:func:`locus.harness.toolset.build_harness`'s ``wrap``.

from __future__ import annotations

#: No harness tool is declared ``idempotent``. The agent loop answers a repeated call to an
#: idempotent tool from the run's earlier result without running it, and a workspace read is
#: not repeatable: after an edit, ``read`` of the same path must show the edit. Seen live on
#: dev (functional F23): a subagent's read after its own edit returned the file as it was.
