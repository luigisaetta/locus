"""Locus control runtime — let an agent act, on your terms.

The domain-neutral control core. Wrap any side-effecting :class:`Action` your
agent already takes — move money, change infrastructure, grant access, isolate a
host — and it runs only after it clears a :class:`ControlPolicy` you write
(:func:`admit`): low-risk actions proceed, the ones that matter hold for a human,
and every decision lands on a tamper-evident :class:`AuditTrail`. The gate is
code that runs *before* the action, not a rule in the prompt — so a model that is
fooled still cannot act outside your policy.

This is framework- and domain-agnostic: the control runtime applies to any
agent that takes real actions. Domain tooling built on this core ships as
separate, opt-in distributions (the security-domain tooling is
``locus-sdk-security``, imported as :mod:`locus_security`).

    from locus.control import Action, ControlPolicy, AuditTrail, admit, AdmissionError

    policy = ControlPolicy()        # conservative defaults: production → human
    trail = AuditTrail()

    refund = Action(
        name="refund", asset="cust:4821",
        blast_radius=1, kind="payment", environment="production",
    )
    try:
        await admit(refund, lambda: issue_refund("cust:4821"), policy=policy, trail=trail)
    except AdmissionError as e:
        print(e.decision.outcome)   # -> "require_human"; the refund did NOT run

The grounding and verification layer an admission decision can weigh lives here
too: :func:`ground_finding` ships a typed :class:`Evidence` only when its claims
clear the GSAR threshold (otherwise an auditable :class:`Abstention`), and
:func:`verify` challenges a finding before it drives an action.
