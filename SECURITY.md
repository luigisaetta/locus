# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Locus (the Oracle Generative AI Agentic Harness), please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/oracle/locus/security/advisories/new) on this repository, or follow Oracle's [security vulnerability reporting process](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/reporting.html) (`secalert_us@oracle.com`), including:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and send you regular updates about our progress.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes land on the **latest released minor of the current major**.
Older minors are not backported — upgrade within the major instead, which
[`DEPRECATION.md`](DEPRECATION.md) guarantees is non-breaking.

| Version                       | Supported          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest `4.x` minor            | :white_check_mark: |
| Earlier `4.x` minors          | :x: — upgrade to the latest `4.x` |
| `3.x`                         | :x: — upgrade to `4.x` (the 4.0 changes are listed in the CHANGELOG) |
| `2.x` (published as `tulip-agents`) | :x: — retired; upgrade to `locus-sdk` `4.x` |
| `< 2.0`                       | :x:                |

Pin a major, as in `locus-sdk>=3,<4`, and take the newest minor within it.
Minors ship often, so an enumerated list of supported minors would be stale
faster than it could be maintained; this table is written to stay correct
without edits.

## Security Best Practices

When using the SDK in production:

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys or secrets to version control. Use environment variables or secret management systems.

2. **Tool Execution**: Be cautious when allowing agents to execute tools that interact with external systems. Implement proper sandboxing and validation.

3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs before passing them to agents.

4. **Model Access**: Use appropriate OCI IAM policies and scoped API keys to restrict access to OCI Generative AI and other model providers.

5. **Checkpointing**: When using persistent checkpointing backends (Oracle Database, OCI Object Storage, Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.), ensure proper authentication and encryption in transit — use wallets (mTLS) for Autonomous Database.
