"""The 2.0 control-runtime rename.

``locus.control`` is the canonical home for the domain-neutral control core,
including the grounding / verification layer. The security-domain tooling ships
separately as ``locus_security``; ``locus.security`` is now only a compatibility
shim over both (see test_security_shim.py). The old security-coded names
(``SecurityPolicy``, ``Finding``, ``Verdict``, ``SecureAgent``, ``secure_agent``,
``SecurityProfile``) were removed outright (no shims).
