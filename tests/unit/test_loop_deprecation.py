"""``locus.loop`` on its way out, and the deprecation machinery finally used.

``locus.loop`` is a second ReAct implementation parallel to the one ``Agent``
runs. ``Agent`` never used it — the single reference from the production
runtime was one private helper, which has moved. Two implementations of the
same idea is worse than either alone: they drift, and a bug fixed in one stays
live in the other.

It is public API on a SemVer 2.x line, though, with sixteen exports and its own
reference page, so it gets deprecated rather than deleted. That makes this the
first exercise of ``LocusDeprecationWarning`` — the policy in `DEPRECATION.md`
was documented in two files and had zero call sites, so nothing had ever proved
a Locus deprecation reaches a consumer at all.

The tests that matter here are the ones that would catch a deprecation which
*looks* done and is not: a warning that never fires because the name is still
eagerly bound, and a removal that cannot happen because the supported runtime
still imports from the package being removed.
